/**
 * Implementation of the polygon class methods.
 * They are mostly printing, but other content (copy and move constructor and assignment)
 * are representative of good practice. There are still some minor details left to fix.

/**
 * 1) Very important: fix the memory leak. Address sanitizer may provide a quick help.
 * 2) Change the initializations to uniform initializations with curly braces.
 *          Be careful, not all make sense.
 * 3) move-constructor and move-assignment operator have identical code,
 *          which is difficult to maintain. How can we apply the DRY principle? Fix it!
 *          DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself, i.e. get rid of the code duplicates by reusing the code.
 * 4) copy-constructor and copy-assignment operator have almost identical code,
 *          which is difficult to maintain. How can we apply the DRY principle? Fix it!
 * 5) Nearly all constructors have identical initializations, DRY them by using constructor delegation.
 * 6) Use std::transform instead of for() loop when copying array data.
 * 7) Compare the performance of copy-assignment vs move-assignment (mentally).
 * 8) Install SonarLink plugin for Clion (Settings -> Plugins -> search for SonarLint)
 *          and check if there are more issues in this file and polygon.hpp.
