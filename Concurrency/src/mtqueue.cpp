	// TODO: spawn multiple threads for producer and consumer using the queue
    // NOTE: producer and consumer expect to bind to the queue by reference:
    // 1) STL uses values, therefore plain queue argument might not work: wrap the queue into std::ref instead.
    // 2) Using std::ref is not normal: it is a red-flag that we are doing something wrong.
    //    In this case we are sharing the queue between threads -- dangerous design!
    //    But in this exercise this is how we stress-test our queue in multi-threaded (MT) environment.
    // NOTE: many successful test runs do not guarantee that the queue is MT-safe.
    // You may make your producers to work longer, try running optimized builds hoping to trigger an error,
    // or enable option(TSAN "Thread Sanitizer" ON) in the CMakeLists.txt
    // (remember to regenerate the cmake build by deleting the build directories).
    // Limitations:
    //  - clang++-13 does not ship std::jthread.
    //  - thread sanitizer is supported only on Linux and MacOS.
